Public domain software for processing and analyzing scientific images â€“ a.k.a. ImageJ 1.x.

## Features

* Display, edit, analyze, process, save, and print 8-bit color and grayscale, 16-bit integer, and 32-bit
floating point images

* Read many image file formats, including TIFF, PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, DICOM, and FITS, as well as raw formats

* Supports image stacks, a series of images that share a single window, and it is multithreaded, so
time-consuming operations can be performed in parallel on multi-CPU hardware

* Calculate area and pixel value statistics of user-defined selections and intensity-thresholded objects

* Measure distances and angles

* Create density histograms and line profile plots

* Supports standard image processing functions such as logical and arithmetical operations between images,
contrast manipulation, convolution, Fourier analysis, sharpening, smoothing, edge detection, and median
filtering

* Geometric transformations such as scaling, rotation, and flips

* Supports any number of images simultaneously, limited only by available memory

## Package Parameters

The following package parameter can be set:

* `/AddToDesktop`   - add a desktop shortcut for ImageJ. By default the shortcut will be added for all users
* `/AddToStartMenu` - add a start menu entry for ImageJ. By default the shortcut will be added for all users

eg. `choco install -y imagej --package-parameters="/AddToDesktop /AddToStartMenu"`

* `/User`           - where the user parameter is specified any shortcuts created (`/AddToDesktop`, `/AddToStartMenu`)
will only be added for the current user

eg. `choco install -y imagej --package-parameters="/AddToDesktop /AddToStartMenu /User"`
