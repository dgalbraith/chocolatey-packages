A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
that provides basic notebook support for [language kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) that are supported in
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) today.  Many language kernels will work with no modification.  To enable advanced features,
modifications may be needed in the VS Code language extensions.
