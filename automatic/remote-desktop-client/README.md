Use the Remote Desktop Services client (MSRDC) to access Windows apps and desktops remotely from a different Windows device.

Use and control a remote PC. With a Remote Desktop client, you can do all the things with a remote PC that you can do with a physical PC, such as:

* Use apps installed on the remote PC
* Access files and network resources on the remote PC
* Leave the apps open when you turn off the client

## Package Parameters

* `/User` - override the default behaviour and install the RDS Client for the current user only
  e.g. `choco install -y remote-desktop-client --package-parameters="/User"`
* `/AutoUpdate` - override the default package behaviour and configure the RDS Client to update automatically
  e.g. `choco install -y remote-desktop-client --package-parameters="/AutoUpdate"`
* `/AddToDesktop` - add a desktop shortcut for the RDS Client
  e.g. `choco install -y remote-desktop-client --package-parameters="/AddToDesktop"`
* `/NoStartMenu`  - do not create a start menu entry for the RDS Client
  e.g. `choco install -y remote-desktop-client --package-parameters="/NoStartMenu"`

## Notes

* This package is not for the Remote Desktop Connection (MSTSC) client that ships with Windows. It's for the new Remote Desktop (MSRDC) client.
* This client currently only supports accessing remote apps and desktops from Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365.
* The 32-bit version of the Remote Desktop Client will not run in a 64-bit environment and the installation will fail if forced with `--forceX86`
* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).
  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
