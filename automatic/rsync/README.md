Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool for both remote and local files.

Rsync uses a delta-transfer algorithm which provides a very fast method for bringing remote files into sync. It does
this by sending just the differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both sets of files are at one
of the ends of the link beforehand. At first glance this may seem impossible because the calculation of diffs two files
normally requires local access to both files.
