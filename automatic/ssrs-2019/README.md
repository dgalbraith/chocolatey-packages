SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) provides a set of on-premises tools and services that create, deploy, and manage mobile and paginated reports.

## Features

* **"Traditional" paginated reports** so you can create modern-looking reports, with updated tools and new features for creating them.
* **New mobile reports** with a responsive layout that adapts to different devices and the different ways you hold them.
* **A modern web portal** you can view in any modern browser. In the new portal, you can organize and display mobile and paginated Reporting Services reports and KPIs. You can also store Excel workbooks on the portal.

## Package Parameters

* `/log file` specifies the setup log file location.  By default log files are created under `%TEMP%`.

  Example: `choco install -y ssrs-2019 --package-parameters='"/PID:12345-12345-12345-12345-12345"'`
* `/Edition` sets the custom free edition.  Options are `Dev`, `Eval`, or `ExprAdv`.
