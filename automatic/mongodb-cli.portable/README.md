from the terminal.  Test, script, and execute other actions — all from one tool.

platforms such as MongoDB Ops Manager

* **Organize your resources** Create organizations and projects within your MongoDB Cloud account to easily isolate
resources and manage access by team

* **Autocomplete support** Get up and running quickly with autocomplete, which allows you to easily view all available
commands and syntax
