Virtual CloneDrive works and behaves just like a physical CD, DVD, or Blu-ray drive, although it only exists virtually.
Image files can be "inserted" into the virtual drive from your harddisk or from a network drive by just a double-click,
and thus be used like a normal CD, DVD, or Blu-ray. Virtual CloneDrive supports up to 15 virtual drives at the same
time - no matter if the image file contains audio, video or just simple data. Virtual CloneDrive is fully integrated in
Windows Explorer context menus and on top of all it is free!

## Features

* Mounts images as virtual drive

* Emulation of CD, DVD, and Blu-ray media

* Unmount image with eject button
* Seamless integration in Windows Explorer context menu
* Easy to use - just double-click an image file to mount as a drive
* Virtual CloneDrive is freeware, you may use it at no cost
