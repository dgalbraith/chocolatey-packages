    <description><![CDATA[

Watchman exists to watch files and record when they change. It can also trigger actions (such as
rebuilding assets) when matching files change.

## Features

* Watchman can recursively watch one or more directory trees (they are called  roots)
* Watchman does not follow symlinks. It knows they exist, but they show up the same as any other file in its reporting
* Watchman waits for a root to settle down before it will start to trigger notifications or command execution
* Watchman is conservative, preferring to err on the side of caution; it considers files to be freshly changed when you start to watch them or when it is unsure
* You can query a root for file changes since you last checked, or the current state of the tree
* You can subscribe to file changes that occur in a root
