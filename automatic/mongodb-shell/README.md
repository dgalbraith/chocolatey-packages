The [MongoDB Shell](https://www.mongodb.com/products/shell) lets you connect to MongoDB to work with
your data and configure your database.  With its enhanced usability features (command autocomplete
and syntax highlighting, easy to understand error messages and contextual help), it’s the quickest
way to connect to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

Input and output are easy to read with colorization

### Clear Error Messages

When something goes wrong, error messages are clear and to the point

### Intelligent Autocomplete

Gives you autocomplete options based on the version of the server you are connected to
