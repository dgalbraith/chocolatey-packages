Pylance is an extension that works alongside Python in Visual Studio Code to provide performant
language support. Under the hood, Pylance is powered by [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), Microsoft's static type checking tool. Using Pyright,
Pylance has the ability to supercharge your Python IntelliSense experience with rich type information, helping you write better code faster.

The Pylance name is a small ode to [Monty Python's Lancelot](https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Sir_Lancelot_(Monty_Python)) who was the first knight to answer the
bridgekeeper's questions in the [Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail).
