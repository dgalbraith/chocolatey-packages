Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works
seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy
to build powerful commandline pipelines.

## Features

* **Control your system with powerful pipelines** Pipelines let you command your system like never before. Your system
belongs to you, and it awaits your command
* **Everything is data** Rather than having the need to remember all the parameters to all the commands, we can just use
the same, regardless of where it came from
* **Powerful Plugins** Nu can't come with everything you might want to do with it, so you can extend using its powerful
plugin system

The following package parameter can be set:

users
e.g. `choco install nushell.install --package-parameters="/AddToStartMenu"`
* `/User` - where the user parameter is specified any shortcuts created (using `/AddToDesktop` or `/AddToStartMenu`)
will only be added for the current user
