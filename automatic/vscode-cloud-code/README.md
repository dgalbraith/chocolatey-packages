Cloud Code for VS Code extends VS Code to bring all the power and convenience of IDEs to developing cloud-native Kubernetes applications. With Googleâ€™s command-line [container tools](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools) like [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) under the hood, Cloud Code gives you local, continuous feedback on your project as you build it, extending this local edit-compile-debug loop to create cloud-native Kubernetes environments, on your workstation or in the cloud. Support for [deployment profiles](https://skaffold.dev/docs/how-tos/profiles/) lets you define different environments, like local development, shared development, test, or production, so you can easily test and debug on your workstation or in the cloud.
