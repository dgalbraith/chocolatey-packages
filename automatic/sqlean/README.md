SQLite has few functions compared to other database management systems. SQLite
authors see this as a feature rather than a problem, because SQLite has an
extension mechanism in place.

There are a lot of SQLite extensions out there, but they are incomplete,
inconsistent and scattered across the internet. sqlean brings them together,
neatly packaged into domain modules, documented and tested.

SQLean provides a well-thought set of domain modules with a convenient API - a
kind of standard library for SQLite.

## Package Parameters

* `/InstallDir=[directory]` - set the installation directory to `[directory]`  
  e.g. `choco install -y sqlean --package-parameters="/InstallDir=C:\Tools\sqlean"`

## Notes

* Extensions distributed with sqlean are compiled in 64-bit and require a
  64-bit SQLite version.
* A 64-bit SQLite shell is currently not available from source but there is one
  available pre-bundled with the sqlean extensions in the [sqlean-shell](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sqlean-shell)
  package.
* A stand-alone 64-bit SQLite shell binary is available in the [sqlite-shell-x64](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sqlite-shell-x64)
  package.
* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).
  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact
  the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating
  correctly.
