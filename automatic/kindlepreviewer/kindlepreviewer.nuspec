    <description><![CDATA[

Kindle Previewer is a graphical user interface tool that emulates how books display across Kindle devices and apps. Kindle Previewer makes it easy for publishers to preview the layout of a book and make sure its text displays properly for any orientation or font size to ensure publishers produce and submit the highest quality Kindle books.

As a best practice we recommend you use the Kindle Previewer to review how their books look across all Kindle devices and apps.

• Easy navigation options to review images, lists, tables and dropcaps without having to go through the entire book.
• Ability to run Kindle Previewer from the command-line interface to validate multiple books.
• Regular updates with access to latest Kindle layout and typographic features that come with Enhanced Typesetting.
• Reflects the layout of the book as delivered to Kindle customers with the latest Enhanced Typesetting features.
• Simplified installer for Mac and Windows that does not require you to manually download additional software.
• Full-page previews without having to scroll.
• Ability to change the fonts during preview.
• Separate navigation pane for quicker page navigation.
• Faster text search, page navigation, and book re-open.
